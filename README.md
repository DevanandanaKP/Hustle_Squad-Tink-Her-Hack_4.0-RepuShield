# Hustle_Squad-Tink-Her-Hack_4.0-RepuShield
RapuShield is an browser extension that analyzes website safety, detects online risks, and protects users from threats. It blurs toxic comments, highlights positive ones, and warns users before posting harmful content—promoting a safer and more respectful internet experience.

Project Description
In addition to website safety analysis, RapuShield promotes digital positivity through its Reputation Shield feature. On social platforms like YouTube:
Positive comments are highlighted
Toxic or harmful comments are automatically blurred
Users receive a warning when attempting to post a negative comment, reminding them that their words may harm others
Users can also contribute to community protection by marking websites as Safe, Suspicious, or Unsafe, helping build a collective trust rating system.
